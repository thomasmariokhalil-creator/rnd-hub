Ensure the server listens on 0.0.0.0 and uses process.env.PORT or port 8080.Once fixed, execute these updates in one pass. CRITICAL: Do not change the <title> tag or main CSS IDs.1. Update 'About' Section:Replace current text with:'Regiopolis-Notre Dame Catholic High School is a cornerstone of the Kingston community, with a rich history dating back to 1845. As the oldest English Catholic secondary school in Canada, RND is dedicated to academic excellence, spiritual growth, and the Garnet and Gold spirit. This Student Hub was developed by Thomas Khalil to empower students with the tools they need to navigate school life efficiently.'2. Update 'School Guide' (Inside Other Tab):Organize the Course Pathways into these levels:Grade 9: All classes are De-streamed to provide a consistent foundation.Grade 10: Students choose between Academic, Applied, or IB Prep (an unofficial taste of the International Baccalaureate program).Grade 11 & 12: Students choose pathways: University (U), College (C), Workplace (E), or Mixed (M). (Note: Mixed courses may not meet specific admission requirements for some university programs).3. Home Screen Logic & Alerts:Smart Snow Day Warning: Create a Garnet-colored banner at the very top of the Home Screen. Logic: This banner should only be visible if (snowDayProbability > 50).Banner Text: '⚠️ Possible Snow Day Tomorrow. Check the Snow Day Predictor for details.'App Update Notice: Add a persistent, small, non-intrusive footer notice: '📢 App Update Available: Please refresh or clear your cache to ensure you are seeing the latest schedules.'4. Pro Feature: Weighted Average Calculator:In the Pro section, add a tool with input fields for 'Assignment Mark (%)' and 'Weight (%)'.The Math: Calculate the running average by multiplying each mark by its weight and dividing by the total weight entered.5. Minimalist Club Cards:Redesign the Clubs section. Cards must be ultra-minimalist.Fields only: Club Name, Date of Next Meeting, Time, and Room Number.Layout: Use the uploaded club images as small, circular thumbnails on the left side of each card."Key Technical Explanations for your Project:The Conditional Banner: By using if (snowDayProbability > 50), you prevent "alert fatigue." If the banner was always there, students would stop looking at it. Now, it acts as a "breaking news" flash.The Weighted Average Logic: Standard averages treat every assignment as equal. In Ontario schools, a final exam is usually 30%. Your calculator will use the formula:$$\text{Average} = \frac{\sum (\text{Mark} \times \text{Weight})}{\sum \text{Weights}}$$The Update Notice: This is essential for web apps on Render. It reminds users that the "new" version of your code is ready, forcing their browser to dump the old version.
